# Responsive-Portfolio
### Objective: 
Enhance the basic-portfolio with a mobile-responsive layout with media queries.

### Specifications - (No Bootstrap)

1. Inside the `Responsive-Portfolio` folder, find the `styles.css` file. Write the media queries at the bottom of `styles.css`.

2. Use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.

3. Make the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. 

4. Be sure to include the `viewport` tag in all HTML files
